# CarousalDemo
A sample app shows Carousal View for RecyclerView with ViewPagerSnapHelper class which lets you scroll the item by one-on-one, added an interface too to retrieve values from clicked item from RecyclerView.
Sample is made with ❤ in Kotlin.

## Update: 1

In code, the location part is set statically to a place named "Bhopal" so now the recycler view automatically scrolls to the same postion where your Bhopal card is avaliable with animation & PagerSnapHelper, sounds Cool ? try it out by setting location value dynamically.


Happy Coding ✌
